/**
 * This interface represents a View in the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern.
 * The view is responsible for displaying information to the user when requested
 * by the presenter. The view also informs the presenter of actions taken by the
 * user. The view does not contain any other logic.
 * <p>
 * Normally, there is a circular dependency between a view and a presenter. That
 * is, the view holds a reference to its presenter and the presenter holds a
 * reference to its view. In the case of this particular MVP-implementation, the
 * view is always initialized first and is also responsible for initializing the
 * presenter (see {@link #init()}).
 * <p>
 * This interface does not require the presenter class to extend any abstract
 * base classes or implement any interfaces. It does not contain any methods for
 * injecting the presenter instance into the view either.
