/**
 * This interface represents a View in the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern.

 * by the presenter. The view also informs the presenter of actions taken by the
 * user. In addition, it is possible to fire {@link ViewEvent}s from the view.
 * <p>
 * Normally, there is a circular dependency between a view and a presenter. That
 * is, the view holds a reference to its presenter and the presenter holds a
 * reference to its view. In the case of this particular MVP-implementation, the
 * view is always initialized first and is also responsible for both creating
 * and initializing the presenter (see {@link #init()}).
