/**
 * This is an abstract base class for {@link View}-implementations and is to be
 * used together with concrete {@link Presenter}-implementations.
 * <p>
 * This view base class is designed to be configured inside a Spring application
 * context. It uses autowiring by type to find its corresponding Presenter. That
 * is, if the application context contains exactly one bean of type
 * <code>P</code>, it will automatically be injected into this view. Otherwise,
 * the initialization of the application context will fail. Please see the
 * {@link Presenter} javadocs for an example of how the view and the presenter
 * could be configured.
 * <p>
 * As a convenience, a {@link I18N} instance is also automatically injected,
 * making it easy to create localized view implementations.
