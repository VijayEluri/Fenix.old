/**
 * This is an abstract base class for Presenters in the Model-View-Presenter
 * (MVP) pattern. It plays particularly well together with Views that extend the
 * {@link AbstractView} base class.
 * <p>
 * The presenter contains the logic that controls the GUI. It reads information
 * from the Model and passes it to the View for showing. It also receives events
 * from the View and decides what to do with them.
 * <p>
 * Normally, the presenter should not contain any code that couples it to a
 * particular View framework, such as Vaadin, JSP or Swing. There are two major
 * advantages with this approach:
 * <ol>
 * <li>It makes it possible to write unit tests for the GUI logic that do not
 * need to simulate user input.</li>
 * <li>It makes it easy to rewrite the GUI using another framework, as only the
 * views need to be reimplemented (well, at least in a perfect world).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This presenter base class is designed to be configured inside a Spring
 * application context. It uses autowiring by type to find its corresponding
 * View. That is, if the application context contains exactly one bean of type
 * <code>V</code>, it will automatically be injected into this presenter.
 * Otherwise, the initialization of the application context will fail.
 * <p>
 * If <a href=
 * "http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-classpath-scanning"
 * >classpath scanning</a> is used to find beans for the application context,
 * the presenter and view classes could look something like this:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * {@link Component @Component}
 * public class MyPresenter extends Presenter&lt;MyView&gt; {
 *     ...
 * }
 * 
 * public interface MyView extends {@link View} {
 *     ...
 * }
 * 
 * {@link Component @Component}
 * public class MyViewImpl extends {@link AbstractView}&lt;MyView, MyPresenter&gt; 
 *     implements MyView {
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </code>
 * 
 * @see AbstractView
 * @author Petter Holmstr√∂m
 * 
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the View.
